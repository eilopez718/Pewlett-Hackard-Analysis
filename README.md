# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis: 

The purpose of the analysis was to help Pewlett-Hackard guage the impact of all the impending retirees on their
departments and identify members of the organization to help ease the organization's transiton though this process. 


## Results:

1. About 30% of the company is projected to be retiring over the next 4 years.  
	
2. The potential departures are not skewed towards anyone one department or title (see % retiring column); they are evenly 
distributed.
	
3. Approximately 70% of the people retiring have "senior" titles, suggesting a potentially significant loss of 
leadership, knowledge, and experience.  63% of the impending retirements come from 3 departments: Development, Production, and
Sales.  These departments should be the primary focus of the re-staffing efforts.
	
4. The average experience for a departing retiree is approximately 24.2 years.
  

## Summary:

![Departures_by_year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68127033/92338164-810dd600-f07c-11ea-8731-6ba3872ced49.PNG)

1. Assuming a retirement age of 68, only 23% of the projected retirement population (16,981 people) are scheduled to leave next year, 
which is only about 7% of the current active staff. The number of departures per year is also fairly constant over the next 4 years, which
should help facilitate a smooth transition. 

2. Whether or not we have a large enough mentoring population will depend on how many of the projected departures we intend
to replace.  Currently, we have average of 1 mentor per 11 departures (or potential new hires.) The ratio for senior positions is
higher than the rest of the population (15/1 for Senior Engineers, 19/1 for Senior Staff) but generally under 10/1 for all other
titles.  Depending on what we feel the optimal mentor/new hire ratio is, we may consider widening the parameters and creating
a bigger pool of mentors.
