# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis: 

The purpose of the analysis was to help Pewlett-Hackard guage the impact of all the impending retirees on their
departments and identify members of the organization to help ease the organization's transiton though this process. 


## Results:



1. About 30% of the company is projected to be retiring in the near future.  
	
2. The potential departures do not skew towards anyone one department or title; they are evenly distributed
	accross departments/titles.
	
3. Approximately 70% of the people retiring are classified as "Senior", suggesting a potentially significant loss
	 leadership, knowledge, and experience.
	
4. The average experience for a departing retiree is approximately 24.2 years.
  

## Summary:

1. Assuming a retirement age of 68, only 23% of the projected retirement population (16,981 people) is scheduled to leave next year.  
	The departures also follow a uniform pattern over the course of the next 4 years.  This means that only about 7%
	of the active staff is departing next year, a much more manageable figure than previously anticipated. 

2. Whether or not we have a large enough mentoring population will depend on how many of the projected departures we intend
	to replace.  Currently, we have average of 1 mentor per 11 departures (or potential new hires.) The ratio for senior positions is
	higher than the rest of the population (15/1 for Senior Engineers, 19/1 for Senior Staff) but generally under 10/1 for all other
	titles.  Depending on where we want the ratio of mentor to new hires to be, we may consider widening the parameters and creating
	a bigger pool of mentors.
